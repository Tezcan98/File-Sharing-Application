# File-Sharing-Application
Using UDP and TCP send file chunk over socket

## CMP2204 Introduction to Computer Networks Term Project
Goal: The goal is to apply the concepts learned in class, through programming and hands-on 
practice. At the end of this project, you will have a better understanding of how a networked
application operates and what are the technologies behind it.  \
Task: Design and implement a peer-to-peer file sharing application. The shared design document specifies the necessary protocols that you need to implement. Please follow the design
doc closely (in fact, verbatim) in your implementation.   \
Requirements: The application should;
1. Have 4 processes: Chunk Announcer, Chunk Discovery, Chunk Downloader, Chunk Uploader.
These processes should work as outlined in their respective specifications.
2. Successfully detect the available content in the peers in the Local Area Network.
3. Successfully download a content from other peers in the Local Area Network.
4. Display an error dialog if a download is in error.
5. Output a download/upload log, containing timestamps, names and chunk index of all
downloaded files.
